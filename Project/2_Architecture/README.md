## SDLC

a) Sensors:

**LM35** - LM35 is a device which converts the physical signal into electrical signal which is also why this is known as the transducer.

**ADC0804** - ADC0804 is an integrated circuit which converts the input analog voltage to its equivalent digital output. (ADC0804 is an 8-bit ADC)

b) Actuators: 

**Motor drive/ FAN** - This is an external device which is the added to implement the output of the system.



### Brief about the components:

1. **Temperature sensor** : It is a device that detects and measures hotness and coolness and converts it into an electrical signal. 

    * LM35 - LM35 is a device which converts the physical signal into electrical signal which is also why this is known as the transducer.
    * ADC0804 - ADC0804 is an integrated circuit which converts the input analog voltage to its equivalent digital output. (ADC0804 is an 8-bit ADC)
    
     **These two devices are used to take the data from surrounding and then converting the analog data to digital**
     
2. **Microcontroller** : A microcontroller is a small computer on a single metal-oxide-semiconductor integrated circuit chip. A microcontroller contains one or more CPUs along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals.

    * ATmega8 microcontroller contains 8 Kb Flash system memory around 10,000 times it can be write or erased.
    * It has 512 bytes of EEPROM and it can perform write or erase operation 100,000 times.
    * It also has 1 Kb internal Static RAM.
    
3. **LCD** : This will be used to display the data. This is a type of flat panel display which uses liquid crystals in its primary form of operation.
4. **TRIAC** :  TRIAC is triggered into conduction in both directions by a gate signal like that of an SCR. TRIACs were designed to provide a means for the development of improved AC power controls.
 
5. **Motor/Fan** : This is an external device which is the added to implement the output of the system.
