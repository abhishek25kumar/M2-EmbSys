# Temperature Controlled DC Fan

 ## Abstract
 
 The project will display the arrangement, layout, development, control and analysis of an automatic switching speed electric fan. The speed of the fan 
 naturally switches as indicated from sensors by environment temperature changes. This venture of a smart electric fan
 can be termed as "clever innovation". The microcontroller base programmed fan substructure introduced in this
 project is required to satisfy the necessity of advances "tomorrow will be better than today".
