# Temperature Controlled DC Fan

 ## Abstract
 
 The project will display the arrangement, layout, development, control and analysis of an automatic switching speed electric fan. The speed of the fan 
 naturally switches as indicated from sensors by environment temperature changes. This venture of a smart electric fan
 can be termed as "clever innovation". The microcontroller base programmed fan substructure introduced in this
 project is required to satisfy the necessity of advances "tomorrow will be better than today".

## Application

 1. This can be used in home applications.
 2. The circuit can be used in CPU to reduce the heat.

a) Sensors:

**LM35** - LM35 is a device which converts the physical signal into electrical signal which is also why this is known as the transducer.

**ADC0804** - ADC0804 is an integrated circuit which converts the input analog voltage to its equivalent digital output. (ADC0804 is an 8-bit ADC)

b) Actuators: 

**Motor drive/ FAN** - This is an external device which is the added to implement the output of the system.
